a. The Industry Talk has given me the opportunity to understand better the work environment of IT specialists in the industry. It has also shown me that it is far more challenging than what we experience as students in our academics. We were also exposed to various ways IT specialists are used in every industry, not just limited to the technology industry.
b. The talk could be improved by exposing the students to more real-life examples of the work they will be doing and showing how vastly different it is compared to what they do during their academic years. Furthermore, explaining more in detail about their career path choices will provide the students with the opportunity to reconsider their decisions and help them make better decisions for their future.
c. In my opinion, the talk was very insightful as it has given me the opportunity to get a glimpse of how it feels to be in the position of IT specialists. It has further ignited my passion to strive better and work harder so that one day I can achieve my career dream.
