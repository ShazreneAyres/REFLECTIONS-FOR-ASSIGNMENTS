a. The Industrial Visit has provided means for me to understand better the career paths available for me to choose. It has also provided ways for me to boost my skills and employability rate through free certifications provided by Oracle Academy, such as Java Programming, Databases, Cloud Infrastructure, and many more.
b. An improvement I would like is to learn more in depth about what’s included in the syllabus for each certification course so that I can prepare and be aware of whether the certification is suitable for me to take for my career path.
c. In my opinion, the Industrial Visit is very helpful as it has taught me more in depth about my future career path and, at the same time, provided ways for me to easily succeed in what I'm trying to achieve.
