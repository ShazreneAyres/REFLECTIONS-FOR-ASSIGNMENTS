This Design Thinking project has emphasized to me the importance of collaborating to solve real life problems.
Designing the prototype have pushed me to improve on my creativity.
I have also learnt how practical the ideas can be as potential solutions.
The discussion and collaboration with the group members have also pushed me to enhance my leadership abilities.
